When teaching private music lessons, it's difficult keeping track of all the information like student and parent contact, billing, lesson materials, and scheduling. Delft Horn Studio is an application to help a teacher stay organized and up-to-date with all the material they need to keep track of. It can show which students have an unpaid balance, when lessons are scheduled, what repertoire was worked on during a lesson, and more.
